        </strong>    <em>The most ancient, modern, difficult and easiest form  </em><em>of expression in the world. </em></br>
    <p>Drawing is an intellectual activity that links sensing, feeling, thinking and doing. It is a way to visually represent what’s in our minds and memory and to communicate those ideas with others. <br />
    By drawing, we can link the internal world of memories and thoughts with the exterior world. Drawing can help us to understand diffrent views of our world and to interpret and communicate ideas.</p>
    <p><img src="purpose.jpg" width="89" height="25" /><br />
    For a graphic designer, the fundamental value of visual literacy* is clear. Drawings, and especially collections of drawings by individuals, offer a starting point to gather material for the study of the society’s visual memory. For my graduation project on the Royal Academy of Art, I will use drawings of different people in order to communicate in a new way. </p>
    <p>*Visual literacy is the ability to interpret, negotiate, and make meaning from information presented in the form of an image. Visual literacy is based on the idea that pictures can be “read” and that meaning can be communicated through a process of reading. The term ‘visual literacy’ is credited to John Debes 1969.</p>

    <p><em>27/03/15</em><br /> 
      Today a lot of people have been contributing to my project! I have been operating in a lot of overcrouwded trains. Amsterdam was out of engery for a while, so for a lot of peple it took a lot of time to get from A to B by train. I tried to use this situation for my project and tried to make make the best of it together with my fellow travelers. I have been meeting a lot of nice, interested and enthousiastic people! If I'm talking about you, thanks for contributing, you are awesome!    <br />
    </p>
    <p><em>24/03/15</em><br />
      From now on I'm online! :) Ok, this website is not build in a proper way, but I already needed to have a link to refer to. During my work process I will improve this website, make it interactive, well designed and so on. Your drawings will also be online soon! I will keep you updated on the progress of my project. But first I need to gain more drawings by different people.</p>
    <br>

The lanuage of drawings is universal and can not be replaced by any other language. Drawing is an universal skill, you are also able to do it very well! Remember: </p>
    <p>- Bad drawings do not exist!<br />
      - The process is the product.<br />
      - Your personal thoughts are the best material.<br />
      - You don’t need to be an artist to come up with great things.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The most important is what you are expressing, rather than &nbsp;&nbsp;esthetics.<br />
      - Try your best, or not if you don’t want to, but try to put &nbsp;&nbsp;some&nbsp;lines on the paper!<br />
      - And, the most important: have fun! :)
