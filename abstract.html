          <i><font size="2pt">The persuasiveness of visual communication.</font></i></p>
          <p>This thesis explores the persuasiveness of visual communication. The work of a graphic designer is to communicate a particular idea or thought by means of symbols or pictures. The work of a graphic designer can guide people in having a certain opinion. So he has to think about how his work could be interpretated and what the consequences of his work could be. For the visual perception of the viewer, aspects of psychology, visual rhetorics and semiotics play an important role in the process of visual communication. <br />
            <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   </strong>A graphic designer could improve the persuasiveness of his work by studying these types of aspects. However, this also raises questions in relation to the ethical aspect of using knowledge of these aspects. How do graphic designers deal with ethics in their work? I wonder if is it possible to use knowledge of these aspects and be objective and ethical at the same time. Does graphic design have to be an objective way of communication, and is objective communication possible anyway for a graphic designer? <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore the main question that I am trying to investigate is: how objective is graphic design as a means of communication? To answer this question it is important to know something about how  people are influenced in decision making. </p>
        <p>In this thesis I will describe three subjects which are relevant for influencing people in decision making. The first subject concerns psychology. Our brains maintain a model of our personal experience, and contineously update this model. This model consists of associations between ideas that occurred in the past. New actions, developments, interpretations and ideas are based on this model. I wonder how these interpretations from the past have been established in our brains, and what impact these may have on new interpretations that need to be made. The second subject concerns Semiotics: the study of signs and symbols.This is relevant because graphic designers take various visual fields in their job and fill them with constantly changing symbols and signs to convey meaning. The third subject concerns  the role of visual rhetorics in persuasive communication. Visual rhetorics describes how visual images communicate and how we are persuaded by the things we see. When we have knowledge of all these three subjects, we can make predictions about how the work of a graphic designer will affect viewers. </p>
